To deploy this application to IBM Cloud using a toolchain click the **Create Toolchain** button.
[![Create Toolchain](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/)

### Requirements
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/)

### Configuration
Capabilities are provided through dependencies in the pom.xml file.

### Project contents
The BFF application has a health endpoint which is accessible at `<host>:<port>/health`. The ports are set to the defaults of 8080 for http and 8443 for https and are exposed to the CLI in the cli-config.yml file.

The project contains IBM Cloud specific files that are used to deploy the application as part of a IBM Cloud DevOps flow. The `.bluemix` directory contains files used to define the IBM Cloud toolchain and pipeline for your application. The `manifest.yml` file specifies the name of your application in IBM Cloud, the timeout value during deployment and which services to bind to.


Credentials are either taken from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable that IBM Cloud provides or from environment variables passed in by the config file `src/main/resources/application-local.properties`.

### Run

To build and run the application:
1. `mvn install`
1. `java -jar ./target/springbackendforfrontend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

To run the application in Docker use the Docker file called `Dockerfile`. If you do not want to install Maven locally you can use `Dockerfile-tools` to build a container with Maven installed.

### Endpoints

The application exposes the following endpoints:
* Health endpoint: `<host>:<port>/health` e.g. http://localhost:8080/health

The ports are set in the pom.xml file and exposed to the CLI in the cli-config.yml file.
